1. xxxxxxxxxxxxx 
2. xxxxxxxxxxxxx


## Important Notes 
* You are allowed to discuss task problems with your mates.
* It is not allowed to see others solution before submitting.
* Report must include summary about your implementation, sample results and issues that you faced and how you fixed it.
* You must mention any kind of contribution of other mates.



* 1. Simplify the following Boolean expression:


* 2. Give the following logic expressions as a function of minterms and hence simplify using a K-map.

* 3. Review the following combinational logic modules (symbols & brief description):
Multiplexer, binary decoder, magnitude comparator, Adders (full & half-adder)

* 4. A sequential logic circuit consists of two JK FFs as shown below. Assuming that both flip-flops are initially cleared, obtain the output signal waveforms Q1 and Q0 for 5 clock pulses.
